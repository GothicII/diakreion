[History - Change Log]

;===============================================================================


[New in v4.9.0, Snaefellsian] - Aug 22, 2014 A.D.

- 1) Small Changes.
= ('Define Camp' and 'Create NPCs' are no more modal forms.).
- 2) Small Design Changes.
- 3) New Conditions and Multi-Conditions in Dialogs.
- 4) Split Window.
= (You can use additional window, so to have two editable windows on one screen.
   Turn it on in 'View'->'Split Window', or you can open a file in Folder View
   from popup menu, or you can copy a file from the editor to the Split Window.
   The Split Window is resizable and is always deactivated on exit.)
- 5) All Texts In/Export Algorithm Improved.
= (I added support for the function 'PrintScreen'. I also added support for
   definitions of strings, that is e.g. const string = "something". I also
   changed a bit the algorithm, so to support brackets in strings. Please
   retest the algorithm and report if something is wrong.).
- 6) Bug fixes.
and more.


;===============================================================================


[New in v4.8.0, Amphibian] - Dec 19, 2013 A.D.

- 1) Diakreion Plugins.
= (Some features might be locked if you are missing some plugins. Plugins are
   installed into Diakreion folder, subfolder 'Plugins', just copying them there.
   There is no need to restart Diakreion after an installation of a plugin.
   In 'Settings' -> 'Plugins' you find the plugins center, where you can
   download the plugins over Diakreion. Either one after one, or a chosen one,
   or the whole pack. If you are missing a plugin or Library and try a feature,
   which needs it, Diakreion offers the possibility of download of such a plugin
   or Library.).
- 2) ASCs Plugins.
= (I added the possibility to install ASCs of armors and beasts of Gothic 1 and 2.
   The feature is divided into 4 plugins. You find them in upper menu 'Edit' ->
   'ASCs'.).
- 3) Diakreion Library is no longer reported at start.
= (For there are also none-modders, who use Diakreion and do not need Diakreion
   Library, so I changed the Library to be voluntary only.).
- 4) Diakreion Library updated to 1.1.0.
= (I changed the archives from ZIP to 7Zip. So now is the library smaller a bit.
   Therefore Diakreion 480+ is only compatible with Library 1.1+. Older Diakreion
   is only compatible with Library 1.0.).
- 5) Diakreion Gothic Music Player updated to v1.4.2.
= (I added the stop-global-sounds-at-a-point feature for the map scripting. So
   on some points or rectangles the global sounds may be off. I added Diakreion
   Update Checker into DGMP. It checks the version of Diakreion, not of DGMP.).
- 6) Small Game: Sounds of Gothic updated to v1.2.0.
= (I added the stop-global-sounds-at-a-point feature to the map. I added more
   sounds all around the map, for example into the cave, on the rocks, on the
   meadows, etc.).
- 7) Diakreion 7z.
= (I developed a small application to decompress 7z files. It is internally
   used by Diakreion 480 and higher. It can also used manually. Just start it
   and drop whatever 7zip files on it. They will be automatically decompressed.).
- 8) FPS Limit Option in Diakreion Gothic Starter.
= (I added this option so to restrict the FPS to 50 if needed. Implicitly it is
   off.).
and more.


;===============================================================================


[New in v4.7.0, Tenebrien] - Nov 26, 2013 A.D.

- 1) Diakreion Gothic Music Player updated to v1.4.1.
= (I added the Volume feature for the map scripting. Info and instructions how
   to use it is in the commented code of script files.).
- 2) Small Game: Sounds of Gothic updated to v1.1.1.
= (I adapted the map to volume feature, so now it is more balanced. I also
   added several sounds all around the map, for example sounds of camp into the
   camp, sounds of several more beasts, etc.).
- 3) Diakreion VDFS Reader.
= (I made a viewer and extractor of VDF and MOD files in the main application of
   Diakreion. It is similar to the viewer in DGMP, it can play the sound or range
   of selected sounds or folders. Moreover it also opens TEX, TGA, BMP, JPG and
   PNG files, if they are present, in Diakreion Texture Editor. You can use
   double click on the item or 'Action' button.).
- 4) Diakreion Library switched to 7-zip format in distribution.
= (No need to download anew.).
- 5) Bug fixes.
= (DGMP Small Game: Dead-player-revives bug fixed. The borders of maps fixed.).
and more.


;===============================================================================


[New in v4.6.0, Infernis] - Nov 23, 2013 A.D.

- 1) Diakreion Gothic Music Player updated to v1.4.0 Unhcegila.
- 2) Sounds Player in DGMP updated.
= (Now it is stable. I completely changed the system of player. So the player will
   not crash anymore. I also added popup menu to simplify copying the names
   into clipboard. It may be useful for Small Game creation.).
- 3) Small Game: Sounds of Gothic (Zvuky Gothicu).
= (It is in fact no game. You just walk around the country of Gothic and
   listen to its sounds of beasts, of nature, of people, etc. I made it so one
   can simulate the environment of Gothic without having to be in Gothic and
   enjoy its atmosphere, while for example you did something else. The automated
   walk is therefore activated but you can, of course, move by your own.).
- 4) More features in scripting of Small Games.
= (You can mix all the features from both already made maps, mixing the game
   and the sounds. All the new definitions and styles how to do your own map
   you can read from the script files of the new map. It is well commented in
   code. You can also define there the not-walkable points.).
- 5) Game Score Verifier.
= (Once you get score, you get also a code. On the table of Score there is
   Score Verifier.).
- 6) Series of maps.
= (In one script there can be more than one map defined, which will be
   automatically executed after the given time. See the script files for more
   info. You can make so the day and night maps.).
- 7) Auto start of maps.
= (Possibility of auto-start. So you load the script and the map is automatically
   started.).
and more.


;===============================================================================


[New in v4.5.0, Ascomoid] - Nov 17, 2013 A.D.

- 1) Diakreion Gothic Music Player updated to v1.3.0 Resulahens.
- 2) Sounds Player in DGMP updated.
- 3) Diakreion Small Gothic Games.
= (I created special environment in DGMP, which can be played and which can be
   scripted as well. You just load a script and play the game. You can set up
   several settings, pause the game etc. There can be maximal three players
   playing simultaneously at one computer. Most of the settings of the games
   are in script files, but they can be also change in DGMP. You can change
   number of players, set the grid visibility, auto movement. You can also change
   the faces of players by clicking on them.).
- 4) Small Game: Beasts of Gothic (Šílená žøoutamrch).
= (You run for life, while the psycho-beasts follow you. Their velocity grows
   in time rapidly. Once they get you, you are eliminated from the game. You can
   pick up items, which give you bonus points, which make beasts slower or
   quicker or which add more creatures. The longer you live and more bonus points
   gather, the better output score you get.).
- 5) Scripting of your own games.
= (You can create your own games by changing the settings of script files
   in Diakreion\Saves\dgmp folder and subfolders. You can also change pictures
   of items, players, beasts.).
and more.


;===============================================================================


[New in v4.4.0, Tatzlwurm] - Nov 10, 2013 A.D.

- 1) Diakreion Gothic Music Player updated to v1.2.0 Jabberwock.
- 2) Sounds Player in Diakreion Gothic Music Player.
= (The selected WAV files can be played in a row. There is an issue with
   few WAV files, which can not be played and the player crashes.
   'Show Hidden' shows the interior of the archive in a text file.
   The button 'Play' or double-click on a file starts it.).
- 3) Lot of sounds playing of DGMP.
= (You can select a folder and click 'Play' to play all WAV files in this
   folder. The files will be played only at the first level of the folder, so
   not in subfolders.).
- 4) VDFS / MOD files Viewer as part of the Sounds Player of DGMP.
= (Left click will select a file / folder. Right click is similar to
   CTRL + click. You can also use SHIFT + Click. You can 'Extract' the selected
   files from the archive.).
- 5) Fix and update of ZEN Repairer.
= (Save / Load now only ANSI, so to be compatible with Spacer. I added several
   improvements into interface.).
- 6) ANSI Open / Save / Save As File of the main editor.
= (I added this possibility if you want to avoid the use of UTF-8. This is needed
   for example for uncompressed ZEN files. In such files you can use only
   ANSI characters.).
- 7) New Faces / Armors / Head pictures.
- 8) Bug fixes.
= (For example solved Copy / Paste problem over right click.).
and more.


;===============================================================================


[New in v4.3.0, Khromandai] - Nov 8, 2013 A.D.


- 1) Gothic Textures Converter / Editor update.
= (I added the 'Refresh' button to refill the TreeView. I also added the splitter
   so you can resize TreeView and main Image sizes. The sizes are reset to normal
   after restart of Diakreion.).
- 2) Important bug fixes.
= (There were two important fixes needed. One is internal of the program
   and there is no need to explain. The second is that I included only
   32-bit version of Convlett (which can be used on both 32 and 64-bit systems).
   If even so you want to use the 64-bit version of Convlett, you have to
   download and change it by hand.).
and more.


;===============================================================================


[New in v4.2.0, Peridexion] - Nov 6, 2013 A.D.

- 1) Diakreion Gothic Starter update.
= (I included a splitter, so the left list of names can be resized. DGS now reads
   also special national symbols of alphabets. DGS has its own icon, so if you
   have allowed the icons for forms in your system, you will see it.).
- 2) Code Completion updated.
= (Now after clicking CTRL+SPACE you can also move by arrows from left to right
   and otherwise.).
- 3) Diakreion Spell-Checker.
= (There are 14 dictionaries available in Diakreion to provide spell-check of
   files. You can change the dictionaries in upper menu or on the panel below.
   There is also 'Auto' language option, which sets the checker to actual language
   of Diakreion and resets it by changing the language.
   If spell-checker option 'Activated' is checked, so the spelling is being
   checked at any time automatically. Even so the hot-keys 'F9', 'F10', 'F11' are
   provided to evoke the checking of a visible part of file, or of entire file by
   given settings or of all the file. Right click on a word (any word, even words
   that are correct) will evoke the offer of suggestions of words. I proclaimed
   this feature to be only 32-bit feature, but I successfully implemented it in
   both version, so also in 64-bit version of Diakreion.).
- 4) Spell-Checker options.
= (You can modify spell-checker options in upper menu. You can set on/off the
   checking of body of the file, of strings, of short or long comments. If the
   option '50 Lines Only' is checked, so not the entire file is checked but
   only 50 lines starting from caret. By automatic checking of file only
   visible part of file is being checked. You can set
   'Check Entire file by Auto Check' to override the last option to the entire
   file. 'Super Glow' will emphasize the misspellings dramatically.).
- 5) Pseudo-Czech Spell Czech.
= (By right click on a word in Pseudo-Czech the suggestions are shown in
   normal Czech so to be better readable to readers. The inserted word is then
   inserted in Pseudo-Czech, of course.).
- 6) Diakreion changed its distribution archive to 7z.
= (7z is more effective than zip. You can unzip it by most of zippers. Because
   of this feature you can not download the newer version over Diakreion while
   using Diakreion 410 or older. You need to use the web download. After update
   to Diakreion 420 the downloader in Diakreion will be functional again.).
- 7) Only one distribution of Diakreion.
= (From now on there will be no more two distributions (32-bit and 64-bit) of
   Diakreion but only one, which will contain both of versions. It is because
   the distributions differs only in 'Diakreion.exe' file and so for me it is
   much easier to do only one distribution. The 'Diakreion.exe' file is
   the 64-bit version and 'Diakreion32.exe' file is evidently the 32-bit version
   of Diakreion.).
and more.


;===============================================================================


[New in v4.1.0, Sprigganseins] - Oct 26, 2013 A.D.

- 1) Advanced Searcher Updated.
= (Added 'Get Selected Text' buttons, 'Change Search and Replace terms' button,
   and more.).
- 2) Find In Files.
= (You can search in files of a folder, subfolders, or in all opened files.
   You can also specify if you look only through '.D' files or any file. Several
   last searched folders are saved and can be used repeatedly without typing.
   If you have specified the paths to Gothics, then there are in combobox
   also basic paths to some of the Gothics folders.).
- 3) Replace in Files.
- 4) Find In Opened Files.
- 5) The text 'Diakreion' is being highlighted in all editors.
- 6) Convlett Starter in above menu.
- 7) New Settings: Moving Texts Stopped.
= (You have the possibility to stop the moving texts.).
- 8) Diakreion Gothic Music Player Updated to v1.1.1.
= (Small update so the settings of possible stopping of texts is applicable also
   on DGMP.).
- 9) User Panel Updated.
= (I added the starter of Diakreion Gothic Starter.).
- 10) Diakreion Gothic Starter (DGS).
= (It is the starter of games and mods of Gothic 1 and 2. Click on the line
   will select the line, double click will start the mod / game. Also key 'UP'
   and 'DOWN' will select, 'RETURN' will start. The paths to Gothics must be set.
   You can also show either all the games or of one of the Gothics. Maximum of
   3 web links is supported.).
- 11) Pictures in Diakreion Gothic Starter.
= (There is a possibility to show pictures in DGS. If the INI is called for example
   'Thanatos.ini', then 'ThanatosB.jpg' stands for the background image,
   'Thanatos1.jpg' for the 1st screen, ..., 'Thanatos4.jpg' to 4th screen.
   The click on any of the images (even also on the background) will enlarge
   the chosen picture on the most of the panel. The next click on enlarged
   picture will make it small again.).
- 12) Description of mods in Diakreion Gothic Starter.
= (Supported are several types. You can use plain text, you can use simple RTF
   file or you can include a file per 'simlink' command ('!<symlink>GothicGame.rtf').
   The included file can be text file or RTF file. The most of the RTF commands
   are ignored with exception of '\RTF' (it introduces the start of RTF file),
   '\par' (new line), and '\qc' (centered text). The rest is ignored and may be
   included in some future release of Diakreion, so you can use the commands.).
and more.


;===============================================================================


[New in v4.0.0, Struthopodes] - Oct 22, 2013 A.D.

> Big release.

- 1) Animal Generator / Creator.
= (The strength of the animal at 1 is the original strength. Any other step means
   10% higher. Level rises by 1 every 7 steps. There can be also negative steps,
   which make the animal weaker. The attributes are automatically generated
   if the checkbox above 'Now' button is checked and so the given values
   are ignored at this case. Checked next button gives random values for attributes
   (changed randomly by +-1/8 of the standard value). Only the attributes,
   where the checkboxs before them are checked, are generated if instance-type
   of creation is chosen. By prototype, everything is generated, but not
   the instance. 'The Based on' settings affects most of the generated creature,
   'Subtype' affects only visual and body texture. 'Proto' is the name of prototype,
   'Name' is the name of instance.).
- 2) The Range of Animal Creation.
= (There is also a possibility to create a range of different beasts of one kind.
   The number right to 'Create Animal' button specifies the number of creatures
   generated. The first creature is the weakest at the specified strength.
   Every next is stronger a bit. If 'New visual' is checked, so there is also
   redefined the visual function for every generated instance. The other settings
   will have effect to the creation. The 'Name' is automatically changed.).
- 3) Tenebris Creatures Creation.
= (There is 'Auto' button, which creates automatically the range of beasts of
   the chosen kind. You do nothing but choose a creature, check or uncheck
   'New Visual' button and click 'Auto'. Creatures A to Z will be created with
   difficulty settings included and with a bit lowered level gained. No other
   settings - with exception of 'Name' - will have effect by auto creation.).
- 4) Diakreion Gothic Music Player Updated to v1.1.0. - Svadilfari.
= (Now changing the duration will change it realtime, considering already played
   time. I also added Player Tracker, which is only read-only. I also added some
   info about file / segment, and more).
- 5) Image Zoomer.
= (By clicking on any image on the left panel the image gets big over most all
   the screen with all its details.).
- 6) Diakreion FAQ.
- 7) Diakreion User Panel.
= (I simplified the using of Diakreion for none-modders and made the User Panel.
   I put there everything needed for users. The panel is implicitly showed
   at start of Diakreion, accumulating for example the starters of Diakreion
   Gothic Music Player and Diakreion Texture Editor / Converter.).
- 8) New Settings: Texts Moving To The Right.
= (The movable texts can run to the left or right, depending on this settings.
   It affects also the Diakreion Gothic Music Player v1.1.0+).
- 9) Warning while closing Diakreion if there are some unsaved modified files.
- 10) Last Edited File In Front.
= (After you leave Diakreion, Diakreion will remember the last active page and
   by the reopening Diakreion, Diakreion turns the page in front again.).
- 11) Design Changes.
= (For example: Lot of windows got the X (closing) button.).
- 12) Text Selection Info in Editor.
= (You see information like 'Sel-14-19-110', which means the start line, the end
   line and the length of the selection text in editor.).
- 13) Delete File Content.
= (In 'Edit' menu there is new button. By clicking, the content of actual file is
   deleted. It erases only content in Diakreion, so you must save file to
   delete content of a saved file.).
- 14) Fix Me At Random in NPC Appearance Updater.
= (Now, if you generate a face, you may fix some of the attributes, so only
   the chosen attributes will be generated and the rest will be fixed.).
- 15) Searcher Update.
= (In the 'Search' edit on the main window or in 'Advanced Search' you may
   write your search term and then click 'Enter'. The search goes in circles,
   so if you find your last term, then the search continues again automatically
   from the beginning of the file.
- 16) Bug fixes.
and more.

[New in v3.9.0, Martensius] - Oct 13, 2013 A.D.

- 1) Diakreion Textures Converter Update.
= (There are several new features including Texture Tree View, which works on
   Gothic Textures folder.).
- 2) Diakreion Gothic Music Player (DGMP).
= (DGMP is a player of Gothic Music (SGT files) from Gothic 1 and Gothic 2
   installations. DGMP is alone-standing program, even so it can not be run without
   Diakreion. The paths to Gothics must be set and DirectX9.2c must be installed.
   DGMP scans for all SGT files and lists them, so also the music of mods can be
   played. The music plays for a given time, than starts another music.
   The settings of DGMP and Diakreion is shared and can be changed only
   from within Diakreion. Due to incompatibility of DirectX headers there is only
   32bit version of DGMP, which, of course, can be run also in 64bit systems.).
and more.


;===============================================================================


[New in v3.8.0, Merloiensis] - Oct 9, 2013 A.D.

- 1) Diakreion Texture Converter, supports TEX, TGA, BMP, JPG, PNG.
= (Throwing one or more textures on Diakreion Converter is the fastest way how to
   convert textures. Concerning TEX pictures, I tested only types 2,6,8,10,12. If
   you use another type of TEX textures and something goes wrong, send me this
   texture, so I can balance it. If you want to produce TEX pictures, you should
   specify the format. By default is used DXT1 without Alpha.).
- 2) Simple drawing on the image in Diakreion Texture Converter.
- 3) Several color effects in Diakreion Texture Converter.
and more.

- 5) Bookmarks.
= (You can click on the gutter of editor to make a mark. Last mark produces also
   red-colored line. In the right below there is a movable panel where you can
   jump on bookmarks or delete them all.).
- 6) Loading of files extremely fast now.
= (I extremely sped up the algorithm of loading files.).
- 7) TreeView Upgrade.
= (Objects in TreeView are now more organized, it has new possibilities as
   collapsing, expanding and reloading of all or a location.).
- 8) OU Generator and Audio Dubbing Checker sped up by cca 30 per cent.
= (It has also new graphical output. I wrote for it a new algorithm. Now you
   can switch between old, that is slower, and new, that is faster, algorithm.
   The result is the same.).
- 9) Bug fixes.
and more.


;===============================================================================

= (In sense of highlighter.).
- 4) Images of files on top of pages in editor.
- 5) ZENs Updater.
= (ZENs should be named WORLD_001.ZEN, WORLD_002.ZEN etc. Then when you update the
   MOD file, you must rename the ZEN with the highest number to WORLD.ZEN. Now
   the copying and renaming is done by Diakreion ZENs Updater.).
- 6) NPC Appearance Updater.
= (It scans actual file for head, face, body and armor, and gives the
   possibility to change them visually and then set back into actual file or
   to clipboard.).
and more.


;===============================================================================


[New in v3.5.0, Saturnion] - Sep 19, 2013 A.D.

> Semi-Big release.

Important!

- 1) At start I must emphasize the most important change. I divided Diakreion in two
parts. The Diakreion program and the Diakreion library. You need to download both
and to install both to run the Diakreion. The reason for this is that the Library is
big and I won't change it too often. So you need to download this part only once
or update it from time to time. On the other hand I made updates for Diakreion
program very often, every several days.
- The installation of library is very simple. Just copy the files into the folder
of Diakreion so in the Diakreion folder there will be the folder library. Diakreion
scans at start for the library and for its version and may offer you to download
it if necessary.
- Anytime you should use the newest version of both, of Diakreion and of its library.
- Diakreion may run also without the library but then lot of features can fail, so
I always advice to have installed the newest library.

- 2) Hints in Editor.
- 3) CTRL + Mouse makes link
= (While hovering over a known word, of which Diakreion knows the definition).
- 4) Im/Export Texts works now only on D-Files.
- 5) StayOnTop Settings for Windows of Diakreion.
= (Most of windows have now a checkbox on themselves to switch on or off the
   settings of staying atop).
- 6) New features of FolderView.
= (In popup menu of the FolderView you can collapse or expand all the tree.
   I created also several buttons, which transport you at the special - commonly
   used - locations in the FolderView like folders Dialoge, Items, NPC, Story, or
   files Startup.d, Story_Globals.d, Text.d or Gothic.src. You can also open
   the selected folder or a file of a folder in windows explorer.).
- 7) Go To Folder
= (In main menu you can navigate to main folders of selected Gothic. The path to
   Gothic must be set.).
- 8) Movable panel of languages on main window.
= (The language panel is hidden by default. By moving the mouse over the button,
   where the panel should be, starts timer and opens the panel slowly. The panel
   stays open for several seconds and the moves back.).
- 9) I made connection to VDFS application in the Gothic installation on the main window.
- 10) Gothic Basic Script Installer.
= (Diakreion installs the basic scripts of several languages into the wished
   folder, which should be empty.).
- 11) Aeternitas's Script Packet installable by Diakreion Script Installer.
- 12) VOB Catalog added to the Diakreion library.
- 13) Texture Library added to the Diakreion library.
- 14) MOB Catalog added to the Diakreion library.
- 15) PFX Catalog added to the Diakreion library.
= (All catalogs are put on main window on a movable panel.).
and more.


;===============================================================================


[New in v3.4.4, Sauropodia] - Sep 15, 2013 A.D.

- Update of FolderView
= (it has lot of new features like Create New File / Folder / Delete file or
   folder / Open in Diakreion, Open All files from a folder in Diakreion,
   I redesigned it completely).
- Redesigned TreeView.
- Music Player
= (there is a start music in Diakreion and the music in Diakreion, there is
   also ambient music, I built in special player, so one can switch between
   musics or shut them down etc.)
- Diakreion Gothic Starter
= (from now Gothic is started from Diakreion. It is applicable for Gothic 1 and
   2, and both Spacers. If you want to start Spacer, you must check Run Spacer
   button. You can also specify lot of features like parsing etc. To be able
   to start Gothic from Diakreion, the path to Gothic must be set in Advanced
   Settings. If you want to start another Gothic, you must reset the path.
   I plan for future releases special functin, so one could specify both paths
   in the same time).
- Highlighted objects raised over 6000.
- Convlett v1.9 (Author Aeternitas) is now part of distribution.
- NPC Viewer (Author Marthog of wog.de) is now part of distribution.
- A range of bug fixes and design changes.
and more.

The item-creator is still not finished.

;===============================================================================

[New in v2.8, Metuzalion] - Aug 22, 2013 A.D.

- FolderView
= (it is hidden by default, but may be uncovered in View)*
- Panel variability
= (you can move the panel from left to right and from right to left without limitations).
- Some design smaller changes
= (for example some buttons has now also picture next to description).
and more.

The item-creator is still not finished.

*FolderView works with actual path to Gothic, so you must first specify the path
to use this feature. You can choose a specification, which you want: that is
look-up of any file, look-up of D-files, SRC-files or/and INI files. Also you
can work with the entire Gothic folder or just Scripts folder. All the settings
are on the FolderView panel and can be reset any time.

;===============================================================================

[New in v2.7, Quardrion] - Aug 20, 2013 A.D.

- Implemented Ou.bin and Ou.csl generator
= (not dependent on Redefix, it is a different system*).
- Redefix (by Sumpfkrautjunkie of wog.de)
= is now part of the distribution
  (with a consent of the author). It may be started from within the Diakreion but
   only if Diakreion is started under admin rights.
- Advanced settings.
- Replace in all opened files.
- Improvements of ex/importer of texts of dialogs.
- Copy All and Paste All in ex/importer will select all and copy or paste.
- Check of availability of dubbing to all dialogs.

- INI files support.
- Bug fixes.
and lot more.

The item-creator is still not finished.

*Redefix works differently. It works on SRC files. Diakreion works on every D file
with some exceptions. Even so the result is the same. Setting the path to Gothic
in Diakreion resets the path in Redefix.

;===============================================================================

[New in v2.6, Barbarium] - Aug 14, 2013 A.D.

- I completely changed the description-search algorithm.
It's now more effective (finds more objects and ignores some not important) and 6 times faster.
- A bit design changes and small bug fixes.

I recommend to rescan the database after installing the actual version.

The item-creator is still not finished.

;===============================================================================

[New in v2.5, Splendensis] - Aug 13, 2013 A.D.

> Semi-Big release.

- Database of keywords, constants, objects reached over 5950,
- I implemented new search-description system (more info below)
and more.

Beware the items creator. It's still not finished and there are some objects,
which seem to be finished but they are not. So be careful while creating items :-).

The new search-description system:
= If you type F1 in the text, the actual word is selected from a given database
  and the help is brought on the lower panel with an exact description. This
  database must be created first. Click Rescan to find the Scripts folder
  of Gothic 2 and Diakreion will look for all constants, variables, functions,
  classes, prototypes and instances. Click on the Definition button or the object
  label to get to the place of definition of the object (or put F3).

= If you want to create descriptions for the objects, type F2 and fill in the
  edit for a given object. Then click on Save. The Erase button is for erasing
  the actual description from the database.

This is very important and useful update and I recommend to update the program
immediately. The re-scanning for objects might take several minutes or ten of
minutes on slower machines, but it's very handy for modern programming methods.

;===============================================================================

[New in v2.4, Aegypticus] - Aug 9, 2013 A.D.

[New in v1.7] - Jan 29, 2013 A.D.

Bug fixes (IMPORTANT!!!), NPC/NPCs creation.

Jeste doplnim k nove vlastnosti:

Kdyz zadate seznam jmen NPC a navolite si ruzne vlastnosti, tak Diakreion postavy
vytvori, k nim i rutiny, jejich rozlozeni, da postavam veci, tvare, obleceni,
no proste vse, a rovnez jim vytvori soubor, kde postavu vlozi a taky soubor dialogu,
kde vlozi ukoncovaci dialog. Dela proste uplne vse, na co si vzpomenete. I priradi
waypointy. Tak behem dvou sekund jste schopni udelat 900 plnohodnotnych NPC.

;===============================================================================

[New in v1.6] - Jan 23, 2013 A.D.

Syntax check. Bug fixes.

What makes syntax checker:

It doesn't check all the errors. It checks only few (I think very common mistakes).

1) It checks duality of brackets ( and ). If it finds a mistake, then it stops checking.
2) It checks duality of brackets { and }. If it finds a mistake, then it stops checking.
3) It checks duality of ".
4) It checks ; after } with exception of } else.
5) It checks uniqueness of names of dialog files.

If the checker says there's no error or warning, it may happen that there are
some other errors, different from the above mentioned errors.

The checker says on which line it detects the problem. Of course it is relative.
Double click on the error will transport you to the problem line. If you don't
see the problem at the line, go some line back.

The checker goes also through comments, so if you have brackets in comments
then they will be checked as well.

I recommend to use the checker frequently, so you avoid some basic errors
before you go through Gothic environment.

If you want to extend the checker of some feature, write to the discussion
thread and specify the feature of your wish.
